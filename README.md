# plates

`plates` is an R package with R Markdown templates following visual identity guidelines e.g. from the University of Leicester or Karolinska Institutet.
All templates can be used by following `New file` > `R Markdown...` > `From Template` in RStudio.

Included templates are for beamer slides; if you want HTML slides, you can find some relevant themes for `remark.js` presentations in the [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package.

# Installation

`plates` is only on GitHub at the moment, and may never make it to CRAN. 
Install the package from Github using `remotes`:

```r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("ellessenne/plates")
```
